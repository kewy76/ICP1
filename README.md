My first in class programming project

6/5/2018

I had three projects as part of this.

The first one was to print the differences between Python version 2 and Python version 3, then to say which version of Python the computer is using.
I wrote a basic multi line string and printed it, followed by the version of Python I'm using (which I got from the "sys" module.)

The second project was to take in the user's first and last name, then print them out in reverse order (last name, then first name.)  Then you would take two numbers, divide them, and print the quotient and the remainder.
I wrote input code to recieve the user's names then reversed the variable order in my output statement.  I then recieved the two numbers, cast them to integer type, performed the operations (and stored my answers in new variables,) then wrote an output statement.

The third project was to create a random integer between 0 and 9, which would be hidden from the user.  The user then guesses numbers until they come across the right one.
I created a random integer (using the "random" module) and made a "while" loop, so that the loop would terminate when the user's input matched the random number.  I also wrote some output statements so that the program would tell the user if their guess was too high or too low (or correct.)
